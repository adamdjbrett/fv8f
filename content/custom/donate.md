To make a donation with a check, make the check payable to the Early Ford V-8 Foundation Museum, P.O. Box 284, Auburn, IN 46706. Please indicate which fund you'd like your donation to go to - General Fund or Building Fund. If you wish to donate using your credit card, but not online, please call us at [260-927-8022](tel:+12609278022).  

To make a donation electronically online, click the DONATE button below. You will see **"General fund or Building fund"** during this process. Click on it and you'll see a place to type in your choice. Please fill this in so we'll know where to apply your donation. If you don't, the money will go into the General fund. You can also use this space to send us special instructions.  

**The Donate** button will take you to Paypal where you can use your Paypal account _if you have one and wish to use it._ **However, if you DO NOT have a PayPal account, or if you'd rather pay NOT using your Paypal account,** you can still make a safe and secure payment with a credit card. **NO Paypal account is needed nor will you be forced to sign up for one.** Look for that option on Paypal's page when it comes up. The final click will take you to Paypal, and it might be confusing. Trust that as long as you entered your credit card info, you will NOT be forced to sign up for anything. Paypal will send a receipt to the email address you enter in the form. Thank you for your generous support! The appropriate documentation will be sent to you for tax purposes.
