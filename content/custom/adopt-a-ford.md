### Adopt-A-Ford

Here's how it works: There are 3 areas of eligible vehicles in the Museum to adopt: the '30s, '40s and '50. The cost is $500 per year to adopt a favorite vehicle.

When you click on one of the vehicle links, you'll see several vehicles from which to choose. If you find a vehicle you'd like to adopt, make note of the Year, Make, and Model. You might want to make a 2nd and 3rd choice in case the first one you pick has been taken. Then either call the Museum at 260-927-8022 to adopt or download the Adopt-a-Ford form, fill it out and send it in with your payment.

A special "License Plate" which indicates that you are the adopter of the vehicle will be displayed next to it. You will also receive a certificate with a photo of your adopted vehicle.

Note: One month prior to the expiration date of the adoption, a renewal notice will be sent to the adopter. Payment for a renewal of adoption must be received within 30 days of the adoption expiration to keep the adoption active for another year.
