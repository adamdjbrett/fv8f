### Adopt-A-Ford

By adopting a car, you will help us maintain the vehicle. The money will help us:
+ pay insurance
+ make necessary repairs
+ provides preventative maintenance.

How to Adopt A Ford:
There are three areas of eligible vehicles in the museum to adopt: The 30’s, 40’s and 50’s. This
includes large commercial automobiles and tractors.
The cost is $500 for one year to adopt your favorite vehicle.
Go to the website under Adopt a Ford and view the vehicles that are available for adoption.
Make note of the make, model and year of your favorite automobile. Then either:
+ download and fill out the online adoption form and mail in with a check

+ or call the museum at 260-927-8022 and pay over the phone with credit card
You will be sent an Adoption Packet within 2 weeks that includes:
+ An adoption certificate and place to give it a nickname
+ An 8x10 photo of your adopted automobile
+ A typed history of the vehicle
+ 4 free unlimited museum passes that are good for the entire year of your
adoption
+ A reminder note of when your adoption year ends
+ A key fob that says “My other car is at the Early Ford V-8 Museum”
+ Donation form to use for tax purposes

A Sign will be placed in front of your adoption vehicle that states your adoption, with your
name, or who it is in honor of, your hometown, and year. It will also be put on our website.
One month prior to the expiration date of the adoption a renewal notice will be sent to the
adopter, asking if you want to renew for another year with this vehicle, adopt a different one,
or decline to adopt another year.
Thank you for your support! Your donation is a tax deduction and helps to maintain this vehicle.
Enjoy sharing your adopted Ford with friends and family by bringing them in to see it!
