### [Save Early Ford V-8 history.]({{page.url}})

Preserving history through the efforts of museums is one of the most important things a society can do. It educates, entertains, and helps "save the past" by keeping what we have left of the past, safe and secure, while encouraging others to restore and preserve what THEY have.

If you are already a member of the Early Ford V-8 Foundation, thank you. If not, please consider joining. The dues are just $25 per year. You'll receive bi-monthly issues of the Foundation News, and take pride is knowing that you are helping to save Early Ford V-8 history. There's a good chance you love old Fords because you're on this web site! If you have friends who also love Early Ford V-8s, direct them to our site to sign up. If you belong to the Early Ford V-8 Club, encourage your fellow members to join.
