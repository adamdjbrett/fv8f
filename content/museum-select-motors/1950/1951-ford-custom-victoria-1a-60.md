1951 Ford Custom Victoria: Multiple Dearborn Awards since complete restoration, the most recent at the 2023 Grand National Meet. The car is completely stock, except the engine has a Mercury crankshaft for higher compression. It has a 3-speed overdrive transmission, accessory back-up lights, driverâ€™s spotlight, Ford script AGM battery and original type Firestone bias-ply tires. Absolutely everything works like factory new, including the radio and clock. The car is very road worthy and can be driven home.
