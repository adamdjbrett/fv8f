Fantastic news! Winning any division on The Great Race is a remarkable achievement for the Youth Driving Program kids. The National Automotive and Truck Museum and Early Ford V-8 Museum mentors have spent countless hours working with and training these kids about the in's and out's of the Fords they drove across the country to victory.
