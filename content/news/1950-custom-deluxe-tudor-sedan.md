This 1950 Custom Deluxe Tudor Sedan is an early 1950 making it unique. Jeannette Hall purchased this vehicle in 1983. It has been a passion project and she restored most of the car herself. It has numerous awards both in the Early Ford V-8 Club of America and AACA Clubs. It is as close to original as you can find due to not having a frame-off restoration.
