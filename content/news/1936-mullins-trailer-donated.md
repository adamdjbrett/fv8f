Bob and Judy Parmelee donated this genuine 1936 Mullins Red Cap Utility Trailer to the Museum. In fact, it “tailgated” them all the way from Texas behind their Ford F-150! Packed inside the Mullins were the last of Bob’s published book, “Mullins Red Cap Utility Trailer”, for us to sell. See them on the FORD STORE page. They also donated many items to sell and tons of Mullins historical items to keep in our research library. There’s no utility trailer that looks better behind an Early Ford V-8 than a Mullins!
