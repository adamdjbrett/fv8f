This 1939 Ford Standard Tudor Sedan is in its original condition. The car is titled a V-8 60 but has an 85hp engine making this a unique vehicle. Marv has documentation showing the car was only driven 142 miles between 1987 and 2007. This is an outstanding addition to the Museum's growing collection of Ford V-8s!
