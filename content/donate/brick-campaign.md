The Early Ford V-8 Foundation Museum has created a BRICK CAMPAIGN,
"Paving the Way", to provide supporters a permanent way to recognize/remember loved ones, show support of your Company or Organization, and help the Early Ford V-8 Foundation maintain our Museum in Auburn, Indiana.

Bricks are available in two sizes: a 4 x 8-inch brick and an 8 x 8-inch brick which can be customized with your Club or Business logo.

These bricks are used to create a "Flag Plaza" or entrance to the Museum Building

A BRICK ORDER FORM is available in PDF format for you to download. Please submit an order form for EACH brick. This form is Fillable, meaning you can open it on your computer and type in your information, then save it, print it, or email it to us. Custom logo bricks require a camera-ready logo. If you have questions, please don't hesitate to ask. If you wish to have forms sent to you or your organization, please call 260-927-8022.
