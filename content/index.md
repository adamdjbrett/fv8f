### The Early Ford V-8 Museum

The Early Ford V-8 Museum is a one-of-a-kind museum dedicated to 1932- 1953 Ford History. It consists of three major sections: an Early Ford Speed exhibit, Industrial Engine, Farming displays, and a 1940s Ford Service Garage. The Frank Corey Gallery houses many of our 1932-53 vehicles, and Floyd Motors depicts a 1936 Ford Dealership.
