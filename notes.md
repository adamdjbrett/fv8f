9. Authors
    1. Also can you setup /authors/. Authors in the collection should be John Hoham, Jan Jones, fv8f
    2. Each author page should show all posts and events by that author. 
    3. On posts and events the author name and avatar should appear

This is a multiauthor concept, if you want the author page to display all posts made by the author, and this can be done by adopting the lakeback.org concept - we have to change the manual in the YAML file - because it cannot be applied to decap cms, and actually eleventy does not support this so we use custom code. The current scheme runs with the concept of integration to staff, so the author will appear in all posts, then visitors can click on the staff author detail page.
